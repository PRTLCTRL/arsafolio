# Lessons from Debugging at Midnight

*3:47 AM - The clock mocks me as I stare at the screen.*

There's something profoundly humbling about debugging. Tonight, I spent three hours hunting down a bug that turned out to be a single misplaced semicolon in my JavaScript code.

## The Journey

It started innocently enough. "Just a quick feature," I told myself. "It'll take 30 minutes, tops."

Four coffees later, I found myself questioning every life decision that led me to this moment.

## What I Learned

### 1. The Rubber Duck Never Lies

Explaining your code to an inanimate object is surprisingly effective. My rubber duck (named Quackers) has solved more problems than Stack Overflow.

### 2. Take Breaks

The solution often appears when you step away. I found my bug during a walk to the kitchen.

### 3. Version Control is Your Friend

Git saved me from my own hubris more times than I can count tonight.

## The Sweet Victory

When that bug finally revealed itself, the relief was indescribable. It's moments like these that remind me why I love programming.

The struggle is real, but so is the triumph.
