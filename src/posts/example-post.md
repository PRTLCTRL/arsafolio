# How to Add Blog Posts

Adding new blog posts to this site is simple! Just create a new `.md` (Markdown) file in the `src/posts/` directory.

## Frontmatter

At the top of each post, include frontmatter with metadata:

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2025-01-16
slug: your-post-slug
excerpt: A brief description of your post (optional)
---
```

## Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown:

- Use **bold** and *italic* text
- Create [links](https://example.com)
- Add `code snippets`
- And much more!

### Code Blocks

You can even add code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## That's it!

Just save the file, rebuild, and your post will appear on the homepage automatically.
